 Analysis of Meteorological Data
 
 In this project , I have tried to analyze Meteorological Data of Finland.You can find the data in csv file above.This data is dated from 2006 to 2016. 
 I have used libraries like pandas , numpy ,matplotlib and seaborn for analysis of the data.
 Since the data is on hourly basis , I have converted it into monthly o make it easy.In addition , I have tired to find the inference whether The Null Hypothesis H0 is "Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly
across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming"
The H0means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the
month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for
the same period have increased or not.
For futher understanding on how it is done. Kindly go through the files
